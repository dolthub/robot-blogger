# Comparing Dolt with Git and MySQL: `clone`, `pull`, and `push`

As we kick off our blog series comparing Git and Dolt, let's start with three fundamental commands that are essential to understanding how these tools work together: `clone`, `pull`, and `push`. In this post, we'll delve into each command's purpose, provide clear terminal-based examples for both tools, highlight key differences in behavior, output, or workflow, and explain why Dolt is a transformative technology for data versioning.

**`clone` Command**

In Git, the `clone` command creates a local copy of a remote repository. You can think of it as "downloading" a project from GitHub to your local machine. With Dolt, the `clone` command achieves a similar result, but instead of downloading code, you're cloning a database or a dataset.

Example (Git):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
```
Example (Dolt):
```bash
dolt clone https://github.com/dolthub/dataset1
```
**`pull` Command**

The `pull` command in Git fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch. In Dolt, the `pull` command achieves similar results, but instead of fetching code changes, you're pulling the latest data updates from a remote database or dataset.

Example (Git):
```bash
git pull origin master
```
Example (Dolt):
```bash
dolt pull https://github.com/dolthub/dataset1 -b main
```
**`push` Command**

The `push` command in Git uploads your local changes to a remote repository. In Dolt, the `push` command allows you to push your local data updates to a remote database or dataset.

Example (Git):
```bash
git push origin master
```
Example (Dolt):
```bash
dolt push https://github.com/dolthub/dataset1 -b main
```
**Key Differences and Why Dolt Matters**

While the basic functionality of these commands remains similar, there are key differences in behavior, output, or workflow that make Dolt a transformative technology for data versioning. For instance:

* In Git, you're working with code changes, whereas in Dolt, you're working with data updates.
* Dolt's `clone`, `pull`, and `push` commands are designed specifically for OLTP (online transactional processing) databases, making it ideal for large-scale data management.

In the next installment of our blog series, we'll be exploring how to use Dolt with the JetBrains DataGrip SQL Workbench. Stay tuned for a deeper dive into this powerful combination!
