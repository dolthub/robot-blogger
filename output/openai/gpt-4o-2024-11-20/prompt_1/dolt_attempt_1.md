# Comparing Dolt and Git: `clone`, `pull`, and `push`

In the world of software development, Git revolutionized how teams manage and share code. Dolt, often described as "Git for data," takes that same transformative philosophy and applies it to relational databases. But what does this mean in practical terms? In this post, we’ll dive into three essential commands—`clone`, `pull`, and `push`—to explore how they work in both Git and Dolt, and why Dolt is reshaping data versioning just as Git did for software.

## Command #1: `clone`

### Purpose
The `clone` command allows you to create a local copy of a remote repository (in Git) or database (in Dolt). It’s your starting point for contributing to a shared project or dataset.

### How It Works in Git
In Git, cloning creates a complete replica of the remote repository, including its files, branches, and commit history.

#### Example:
```bash
# Clone a Git repository
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
Cloning into 'repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 42, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (42/42), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (10/10), done.
```
After running this command, you get a local folder named `repo`, containing the full project history and files from the remote repository.

### How It Works in Dolt
In Dolt, `clone` works similarly but instead of files, you’re cloning a database, complete with its schema, tables, and version history.

#### Example:
```bash
# Clone a Dolt database
$ dolt clone dolthub/employee_db
Cloning into 'employee_db'...
Received 42 table objects.
Unpacking tables: 100% (42/42), done.
```
After cloning, you’ll have a local copy of the `employee_db` database, ready to query using SQL or modify through Dolt commands.

### Key Difference
While Git focuses on files, Dolt versions *data tables*. When you clone in Dolt, you’re gaining access to a fully versioned relational database, bringing branching and collaboration directly into the world of data.

## Command #2: `pull`

### Purpose
The `pull` command retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository (Git) or database (Dolt) and integrates them into your local environment.

### How It Works in Git
In Git, `pull` fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

#### Example:
```bash
# Pull the latest changes in Git
$ git pull origin main
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward
 file.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
This command updates your local branch (`main`) with any new commits from the remote branch.

### How It Works in Dolt
In Dolt, `pull` works similarly but applies to database changes. It fetches and merges updates to tables and schema.

#### Example:
```bash
# Pull the latest changes in Dolt
$ dolt pull origin main
Updating schema and data:
 - customers: No changes
 - orders: +2 rows updated
Fast-forward
```
The result is an updated version of your local database, reflecting new rows, schema updates, or other modifications from the remote.

### Key Difference
Git pulls affect the files in your repository, while Dolt pulls update both data and schema in your database. This merging of database and version control workflows is what makes Dolt a game-changer for collaborative data management.

## Command #3: `push`

### Purpose
The `push` command uploads your local changes to a remote repository (Git) or database (Dolt), making it available for collaboration.

### How It Works in Git
In Git, `push` sends your commits to the remote repository.

#### Example:
```bash
# Push changes to Git
$ git push origin main
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 328 bytes | 328.00 KiB/s, done.
```
Your updated code is now available for others to pull and review.

### How It Works in Dolt
In Dolt, `push` uploads your database changes to a remote repository like DoltHub or DoltLab.

#### Example:
```bash
# Push changes to Dolt
$ dolt push origin main
Pushing schema and data:
 - customers: +1 row added
 - orders: +3 rows deleted, +2 rows updated
```
Your changes—including new rows, schema modifications, or version history—are now accessible to collaborators.

### Key Difference
Pushing in Dolt doesn’t just upload changes—it enables a new paradigm for collaborative data management. Your teammates can pull both data and schema updates, review changes, and even merge different versions in a Git-like workflow.

## Why These Comparisons Matter

Understanding how `clone`, `pull`, and `push` work in Dolt versus Git underscores Dolt’s revolutionary approach to versioning and managing data. Where Git brought clarity and collaboration to software development, Dolt is doing the same for databases. By combining SQL familiarity with Git-like commands, Dolt enables teams to work on data collaboratively, track changes over time, and manage branching and merging workflows like never before.

For MySQL users, Dolt introduces a new world of version control. No more manual backups or clunky migration scripts—Dolt brings the power of Git-like collaboration into your database environment.
